# The Treebank Revision suite

## What is it?

A series of blocks and bash scripts that are frequently used to manipulate treebanks. 
It's designed to work with:

* the `udapy` framework, and in particular with [my fork](https://github.com/francescomambrini/udapi-python), 
optimized for the AGLDT
* any AGLDT-compliant treebank (including the AGLDT itself, Daphne, Pedalion and the Gorman 
trees)

## How do I use it?

1. Clone this project
2. Clone and install `udapy-python` (preferably, my [forked version](https://github.com/francescomambrini/udapi-python), 
as you'll need all the `agldt` blocks)
3. don't forget to add the `blocks` folder to your `$PYTHONPATH`!
